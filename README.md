# Aerial Media

A simple self-hosted media site.

To add media, put it into the appropriate directory:
* `static/pictures/` for pictures
* `static/videos` for videos
* `static/audio` for audio

This project would not be possible were it not for:
 * [Twitter Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com)
 * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
